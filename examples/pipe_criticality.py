"""
The following example runs a pipe criticality analysis on large diameter pipes
to compute the impact that pipe closures have on pressure in the system.  
The analysis is run using a series of hydraulic simulations with one pipe 
closed at a time and determines if minimum pressure criterion are met 
at each junction.  Note that for many networks, simulations can fail when 
certain pipes are closed. try:except blocks are recommended within the 
simulation loop to catch these instances.
